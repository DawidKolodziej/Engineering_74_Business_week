- Identify: The main process, the claims being made, the evidence used, the conclusions reached
- Analyse: Deos the info make sense?, How old is the material?, is the material clear and strict?, Does the argument present a balanced view or are some topics benig disregarded?
-  To Apply and Compare, look out for: The implications of other information, Weaknesses when applied to a real life situation, A lack of coverage.

#### 3 Modes of thinking:
- Divergent: Question -> Idea
- Convergent : Fact -> Answer
- Lateral : Uses Both

### Software Development Life Cycles:
- Watefall
- Agile
- V-Model

#### WaterFall:
- in a sequence- beggining to end without going back between stages 
- dont test until end 

#### V- Model
- Verify all of he specificatiosn first then start codeing 
- after coding do  all testing like unit testing, integraton testing, system testing, acceptance testing 

#### Agile
- Iterative
- Plan -> Do -> Check 

#### Scrum
- BAcklog ->> Sprint Planning ->> Sprint BAcklog ->> 1 Scrum Team ->> Sprint Review ->> Increment ->> Sprint Restrospective 
- NOT A METHODOLOGY
- Used to manage tassk 
- has a Scrum Master

## Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog
- The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in a product. It is constantly evolving and is never complete.

### Sprint Backlog
- The Sprint Backlog is a list of everything that the team commits to achieve in a given Sprint. Once created, no one can add to the Sprint Backlog except the Development Team. 
- If the Development Team needs to drop an item from the Sprint Backlog, they must negotiate it with the Product Owner. During this negotiation, the ScrumMaster should work with the Development Team and Product Owner to try to find ways to create some smaller increment of an item rather than drop it altogether.

### Increment
- At the end of every Sprint, the team must complete a product increment that is potentially releasable, meaning that meets their agreed-upon definition of done. (An example might be fully tested and fully approved.)
